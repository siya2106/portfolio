    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>

      I am proficient in C++, Python, and C, and I have a good understanding of data structures. I have also worked on several projects. I developed a Python-based application that converts text to speech (TTS) and speech to text (STT) to enhance accessibility and automation. Additionally, I developed an interactive game using Python designed to improve social, cognitive, and motor skills in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. At present, I am working on a new project related to operating systems, which involves the concept of deadlock.
